Certain flags, such as Unbuffered and Truncate, are meaningless when used with some subclasses. Some of these restrictions are implied by the type of device that is represented by a subclass; for example, access to a QBuffer is always unbuffered. In other cases, the restriction may be due to the implementation, or may be imposed by the underlying platform; for example, QTcpSocket does not support Unbuffered mode, and limitations in the native API prevent QFile from supporting Unbuffered on Windows.

The OpenMode type is a typedef for QFlags<OpenModeFlag>. It stores an OR combination of OpenModeFlag values.
