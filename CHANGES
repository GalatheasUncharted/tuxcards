v2.0, amitch@rajgad.com
New:
-File encryption feature. This encryptes all the entries in the file and requires password on
	load. Accessible through toolbar, File menu and shortcut: CTRL+E
-Change text color for a single note or subtree of notes. New entries get subtree color of the parent, if set.
-Added a statusbar item for total number of notes\items.
-Added a dialog box under About menu to show current keyboard shortcuts.

Bug fixes
-Saveas did not work for unmodified files.
-The Base64 decoding had an off by one error which resulted in garabage characters at end of some newly 
decrypted entries. (Not mine)
-Better search results, Show string starting with the matched text and ensure it does not go over a certain 
	limit (80 chars). This results in better visiblity on the found items and no wrap-around resulting in 
	unreadable text.
-Fixed bug of losing unsaved text when dragging and dropping an item. 
-Allow selecting notes with same names(title.)
-Fixed bug of incorrect end calculation in CBlowFish::Encode when using same buffer for 
		encrypted and decrypted data
-Crash on encrypted data size == 0.  (Happens only for dev code)
-Incorrect flagging newly opened file as dirty.

Other minor changes
-When a new note is created or dropped drop, focus now moves to new item.
-Added a menu item for F2(Rename in place edit of tree item.)
-Disabled autoformatting in editor to convert text like - into bullet items.
-Search dialog: Added accelator keys and set main button as default. This also adds support for Enter 
  and ESC key. SearchDialog::SearchDialog()
-Removed unpolite references such as "sorry" from confirm delete dialogbox, "Freaks" from About box.
  Other minor changes in toolbar text, etc.
-Modified qmake file, tuxcards.pro to "make install" work correctly, installs docs and icons. Update tuxcards.pro
 to change DESTDIR.

 
v1.2,
