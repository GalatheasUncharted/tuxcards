<code>Load</code>, <code>Save</code>, or <code>Exit</code> is done
via the <code>File</code>-Menu.<br>

The Toolbar includes the following icons:<p>

To use TuxCards more easily, I advice everyone to use the <b>Context-Menu</b>.
Just click the right mouse button over an entry within the tree-structure and
you are prompted to whether <code>add an Entry</code>, <code>change the
proberties</code> of an entry, or to <code>delete</code> it.<p><p>

<b>Moving</b> entries within the tree is done via drag & drop. Just press the
left mouse button on an item within the tree and drag it to whereever you
like. Release the button to drop and insert your data at the destination
entry.<p>

This way, it is also possible to copy an entry from one TuxCards application
into a completely different one; just by drag & drop.<p>

Note: Whenever you move an entry, all child entries are moved as well.
<p><p>

Changing Color and Text of the <b>ColorBar</b>. The ColorBar is the colored
area to the left of the tree. The colors and the Text of it may be changed.
For this, go to the <code>Options</code>-Menu.<p>

Note: The width of the ColorBar is calculated from the width of the text
inserted. So, if you think your bar is to small just add a few spaces to
the text and see what happens.<br>
Also, if you don't like to have a bar, erase both textfields in the
<code>Options</code>-Menu.<p><p>

Since Version 0.7, the <b>CactusBar</b> is added. As user you have the option to
use the ColorBar as before or to switch to the CactusBar. This is done via the
<code>Options</code>-Menu.<p>

	<b>History about Cactusbar</b><br>
  One of my best friends,
  <a href="http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ukgh/">Markus Gebhard</a>,
  had written a java-program to let grow random cactuses on the screen. I suggested
  to let them grow in a colorbar, a own widget that both of us have implemented.

  Thus, the cactusbar was invented. Since it
  was a java-programm, I began to port it to C++/Qt and included it in TuxCards with
  best regards from Markus Gebhard.<p>

The preferences are set to <b>save</b> your data every 15 minutes. You may
change this if you like.<p><p>

At <b>every start</b>, TuxCards will automatically load your last datas.
The tree-structure (on the left side) is also reproduced as it was found at
your last saving.
