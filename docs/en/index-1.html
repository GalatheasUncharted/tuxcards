<H3><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H3>
What is TuxCards? First of all it is THE notebook for TuxFreaks and
for everyone who likes to use it or finds it useful during his or her
work.<p>

TuxCards is a hierarchical notebook. That was created out of the
desire to let my own chaos of papers, notes, and post-it's vanish. Those
items are useful but the chaos I produced was not.<p>

Now, regular digital notebooks do already exist in lots of different
shapes, there - similar to real notebooks - I found it quite difficult
to keep track of my entries and to sort them.<p>

Through a friend I got to know CueCards; that is a really nice program that
exists for Windows. Since I am using Linux almost permanently, I got the
idea to write a similar tool for myself and let every Linux/Unix user share
it.<p>


<H3><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 General Idea</A></H3>
With TuxCards it is possible to create as many different entries or notes
as you wish. Everytime you add a new one and you think your new entry
belongs to the same topic as notes you already have, then you may decide
to group them and to create a kind of "folder" where you store them
all together. Just the same like you would put your books and paperwork
from your job together in one place and not to the garden utilities
<i>(unless you work as a gardener).</i>.<p>

With TuxCards you have a tool at your hand to enter and manage every kind
of notes and ideas in a structured manner. This makes it much more easier
to find them as you are in need.<P>


<H3><A NAME="ss1.3">1.2 Specialities</A></H3>
  <ul>
    <li>The preferences are set to save your data every 15 minutes. You may change
        this if you like.
    <li>At every start, TuxCards will automatically load your last datas.
    <li>The tree-structure (on the left side) is also reproduced as it was found at
        your last saving.
    <li>Drag & Drop of entries between <b>completely different</b> TuxCards
        applications is possible. Just try it. ;-)
    <li>Cactus-Support, expandable with own flowers.
    <li>There are no theoretical/practical limits on the tree-depth,
        on the quantity of the items and on the size of the text field.
  </ul><p>


<H3><A NAME="ss1.4">1.3 New major & future Features</A></H3>
There are several changes and especially improvments done. Just to name the
most important things:

We have greately tested this version for easy of use and speed. So, a more
intuitive usage is possible.<p>

  In Version 0.7 (August/September 2001)
  <ul>
    <li>Cactusbar!!!
    <li>vertical Text in Colorbar (long names like "Schizophrene Gedankensprünge"
        or "Offline Brain" are possible)
    <li>correct ini-File <code>~/.tuxcards</code> is produced
    <li>own Iconselector
  </ul>

  In Version 0.6beta (Spring 2001)
  <ul>
    <li>slight adjustments to support >= qt2.1 ("no drag after a single click")
    <li>creates backup-file <code>filename~<code> before writting
    <li>mouse points exactly to the position where to drag to
    <li>low-level HTML-Support
    <li>own Icon
  </ul>

  From Version 0.4 to 0.5 (April 2000)
  <ul>
  	<li>Search function has been expanded.
		<li>Improved insert and property dialogs.
		<li>Icon support for the tree-structure; every entry may have
				another icon.
		<li>Self-explanatory "What is" - so you don't really have to read this
				reference.
		<li>This short manual/usage reference as well as online documentation.
	</ul>
	
	Version 0.4 was the first one to be published.<p>


  <b>Future Features</b>
  <center><i>
  I have lots of ideas - and a long list with proposals from dozen of users -
  how to make this little tool even more helpful and the use even more enjoyable
  and pleasurable. If you come up with something that you would like to see in
  a future version don't hesitate to write to
